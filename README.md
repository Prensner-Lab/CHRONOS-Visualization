### Visualization of Genetic Screen Data
- Example plots of the genes starting with MYC and ERBB2 
- The data is CHRONOS data of cancer clusters related to medulloblastoma(Breast Invasive Lobular Carcinoma and Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma) and cancer clusters not related to medulloblastoma(Prostate Adenocarcinoma and Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer) downloaded from the DepMap custom downloads by creating a model context of disease subtype and using the CRISPR (DepMap Public 24Q2+Score, Chronos) dataset.
